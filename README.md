# Description  of Hangman game

Hangman is an educational word guessing game to be playled in a command-line interface.The game has been created with Ruby.When the Ruby script is called, it will start a new game and provide the user with a blank word and a clue. The script takes the user input (letter) and checks it against the selected word for the game. Make too many wrong choices and you will lose. Get all the letters correct to win! I use conditionals, string interpolation, classes, arrays and looping to put our Ruby skills to the test.

# Purpose 

The Purpose of making Hangman game just to learning vocabulary and fun way testing the general knowladge. This is done by allowing the user to guess the secret word one letter at a time which can also be helpful for remembering the spelling of new words.
